# Writing Tests for the TASKS

You can use the testthat package to write tests in R. First, install the package if you haven't already.
# Load necessary libraries
library(testthat)

# Source the functions to be tested
source("orders.csv")

# Define the tests
TEST1:

test_that("Monthly revenue computation", {
  monthly_revenue <- df %>%
    group_by(month) %>%
    summarise(total_revenue = sum(total_price))
  
  expect_true(nrow(monthly_revenue) > 0, info = "Monthly revenue computation failed")
})

TEST2:

test_that("Product revenue computation", {
  product_revenue <- df %>%
    group_by(product_id, product_name) %>%
    summarise(total_revenue = sum(total_price))
  
  expect_true(nrow(product_revenue) > 0, info = "Product revenue computation failed")
})

TEST 3:

test_that("Customer revenue computation", {
  customer_revenue <- df %>%
    group_by(customer_id) %>%
    summarise(total_revenue = sum(total_price))
  
  expect_true(nrow(customer_revenue) > 0, info = "Customer revenue computation failed")
})

TEST 4:
test_that("Top 10 customers computation", {
  customer_revenue <- df %>%
    group_by(customer_id) %>%
    summarise(total_revenue = sum(total_price))
  
  top_10_customers <- customer_revenue %>%
    arrange(desc(total_revenue)) %>%
    head(10)
  
  expect_equal(nrow(top_10_customers), 10, info = "Top 10 customers computation failed")
})
