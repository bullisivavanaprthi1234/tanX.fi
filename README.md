# Problem Statement 
You have been given a dataset of customer orders from an online store. The data is in a CSV file `orders.csv` with the following columns: 
● order_id: unique identifier for each order 
● customer_id: unique identifier for each customer 
● order_date: date when the order was placed 
● product_id: unique identifier for each product 
● product_name: name of the product 
● product_price: price of the product 
● quantity: quantity of the product ordered 
Your task is to write a Python program that reads the data from the CSV file and performs the following tasks: 
1. Compute the total revenue generated by the online store for each month in the dataset.
2. Compute the total revenue generated by each product in the dataset. 
3. Compute the total revenue generated by each customer in the  dataset.
4. Identify the top 10 customers by revenue generated.
